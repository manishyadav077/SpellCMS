# SpellCMS â€” Frontend Developer Challenge Submission

This is my submission for the **SpellCMS Frontend Developer Challenge** by Spell Innovation, Kathmandu.

I built a **mini Content Management System (CMS)** dashboard where users can authenticate and manage blog content including posts, categories, and authors. The project focuses on clean architecture, scalable frontend development, and good user experience.

## Features Implemented

- **Authentication**  
  - Email/password login with mocked token-based auth stored in `localStorage`
  - Create a new account
  - Persistent login state with protected routes and redirects for unauthenticated users  

- **Blog Posts Management**  
  - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on blog posts  
  - Post form with fields: Title, Author (dropdown), Category (dropdown), Tags (multi-input), Status toggle, Cover Image URL with preview  
  - Change post status between Draft and Published  

- **Categories Management**  
  - Add, edit, and delete blog categories
  - 
- **Authors Management**  
  - CRUD operations on authors including name, avatar, and bio  

- **Search & Filter**  
  - Search blog posts by title or tags  
  - Filter posts by status and category
